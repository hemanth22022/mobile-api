GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other people to view, fetch, and update.
When you git clone, git fetch, git pull, or git push to a private remote repository using HTTPS URLs on the command line, Git will ask for your GitHub username and password. When Git prompts you for your password, enter your personal access token. Alternatively, you can use a credential helper like Git Credential Manager. Password-based authentication for Git has been removed in favor of more secure authentication methods. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens.

If you are accessing an organization that uses SAML SSO and you are using a personal access token (classic), you must also authorize your personal access token to access the organization before you authenticate. For more information, see About authentication with SAML single sign-on and Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on.
